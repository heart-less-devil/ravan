# Credit System Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The credit system was **automatically regenerating credits** every time users fetched their subscription status, which caused:
1. Credits not being permanently consumed
2. Free users getting unlimited credits by refreshing
3. Paid users getting credits reset unexpriedly

## Root Cause
Two endpoints were auto-renewing credits on every API call:
- `/api/auth/subscription` (lines 8179-8241)
- `/api/auth/subscription-status` (lines 8276-8350)

These endpoints had logic that checked if credits should be renewed and then **automatically updated** the user's credits in the database, defeating the purpose of credit tracking.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed `/api/auth/subscription` Endpoint ✅
**Changed:** Removed automatic credit renewal logic
**Now:** Only **reads** credits from database, never modifies them
**Exception:** Still enforces 0 credits for expired free trials (> 5 days)

```javascript
// BEFORE: Auto-renewed credits on every call
if (!lastCreditRenewal || now >= nextRenewal) {
  shouldRenewCredits = true;
  mockDB.users[userIndex].currentCredits = creditsToGive; // BAD!
}

// AFTER: Only reads from database
let currentCredits = user.currentCredits || 0;
console.log('✅ Returning credits from database:', currentCredits);
```

### 2. Fixed `/api/auth/subscription-status` Endpoint ✅
**Changed:** Removed automatic credit renewal logic  
**Now:** Only **reads** credits from database, never modifies them
**Exception:** Still enforces 0 credits for expired free trials (> 5 days)

### 3. Enhanced Webhook Credit Assignment ✅
**Changed:** Added comprehensive plan-to-credit mapping
**Added Plans:**
- `monthly`: 50 credits
- `annual`: 100 credits  
- `test`: 1 credit

**All Plans Now Supported:**
- Free: 5 credits (one-time on signup)
- Test: 1 credit
- Monthly: 50 credits
- Annual: 100 credits
- Daily-12: 50 credits
- Basic: 50 credits
- Premium: 100 credits
- Basic-Yearly: 50 credits
- Premium-Yearly: 100 credits

### 4. Verified Signup Credit Allocation ✅
**Status:** Already working correctly
**Implementation:** New users get exactly 5 credits on signup
**Location:** `server/index.js` line 1949

```javascript
currentCredits: 5  // One-time allocation, consumed permanently
```

### 5. Credit Consumption Already Working ✅
**Status:** Already implemented correctly
**Location:** `server/index.js` lines 8522-8681
**Implementation:** 
- `/api/auth/use-credit` endpoint properly deducts 1 credit
- Saves to both MongoDB and file storage
- Tracks usage history with timestamps
- Credits are consumed when emails are revealed

## How Credits Work Now

### For New Users (Free Plan)
1. Sign up → Get exactly **5 credits**
2. Use credits → Credits decrease permanently
3. After 5 days → Credits expire, set to 0
4. **Credits NEVER regenerate** for free users

### For Paid Users
1. Purchase plan → Get credits based on plan type
2. Use credits → Credits decrease permanently  
3. Credits only renewed on **actual payment** (via Stripe webhooks)
4. **No automatic renewal** on API calls

### Credit Consumption Flow
```
User Opens Email → Check Credits > 0 → Call /api/auth/use-credit
    ↓
Deduct 1 Credit → Save to MongoDB → Update UI
    ↓
Credits Permanently Consumed (Never Restored)
```

## Files Modified
- `server/index.js`:
  - Line 8179-8223: Fixed `/api/auth/subscription` endpoint
  - Line 8276-8350: Fixed `/api/auth/subscription-status` endpoint
  - Line 390-414: Enhanced webhook credit assignment
  - Line 1940: Added comment for signup credits

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Test Free User Credits
```bash
# Create new user
POST /api/auth/create-account
# Should have 5 credits

# Use a credit
POST /api/auth/use-credit  
# Should have 4 credits

# Refresh subscription
GET /api/auth/subscription
# Should STILL have 4 credits (not reset to 5)
```

### 2. Test Paid User Credits
```bash
# Purchase basic plan
# Should get 50 credits

# Use 10 credits
# Should have 40 credits

# Refresh subscription multiple times
GET /api/auth/subscription
# Should STILL have 40 credits (not reset to 50)
```

### 3. Test Trial Expiry
```bash
# Create user, wait 5+ days
# Credits should be forced to 0
# Should not allow credit usage
```

## Benefits of This Fix

✅ **Credits are now permanent** - Once consumed, never come back  
✅ **Free users get exactly 5 credits** - No more, no less  
✅ **Paid users get plan-specific credits** - Exact amounts  
✅ **Email reveals consume credits** - One credit per email  
✅ **No automatic regeneration** - Credits only added via payments  
✅ **MongoDB persistence** - All changes saved to database  
✅ **Trial enforcement** - Free trials expire after 5 days  

## Key Principle
**Credits should ONLY be added or renewed through:**
1. New user signup (5 credits for free plan)
2. Stripe payment webhooks (plan-specific credits)
3. Admin manual adjustments (if needed)

**Credits should NEVER be added or renewed through:**
1. Fetching subscription status
2. Logging in
3. Refreshing the page
4. Any GET requests
