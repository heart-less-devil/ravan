# API Network Error Fix Guide

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Network Error on Login Page
**Problem**: API calls were returning HTML instead of JSON, causing "Network error" messages.

**Root Cause**: 
- Netlify redirect configuration was incorrect
- API endpoints were being redirected to frontend instead of backend

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `netlify.toml` to properly redirect `/api/*` to backend server
- Changed redirect from `https://ravan-8n0h.onrender.com/api/:splat` to `https://ravan-8n0h.onrender.com/:splat`

### 2. 404 Page Issue
**Problem**: Site was showing 404 errors for certain routes.

**Root Cause**: 
- Frontend routing configuration issues
- Missing proper fallback routes

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `public/404.html` to redirect to main app
- Ensured proper SPA routing in `netlify.toml`

### 3. API Configuration Updates
**Problem**: Frontend was using incorrect API URLs.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `src/config.js` with correct backend server URL
- Added `https://ravan-8n0h.onrender.com/api` to fallback URLs
- Ensured proper API URL resolution for production

## Files Modified

1. **netlify.toml** - Fixed API redirect configuration
